Fixing duplicate isLoading state variable and simplifying AI generation button

---

Fixing duplicate isLoading state by creating separate aiGenerating state and replacing Button with native button

---


The duplicate `isLoading` state variable has been fixed by:

1. **Removed duplicate declaration** - kept only one `isLoading` state for dashboard data loading
2. **Added separate `aiGenerating` state** - for AI generation loading state
3. **Updated AI generation function** - uses `aiGenerating` instead of `isLoading`
4. **Replaced Button component** - with native button element to ensure CSS styles work

The error should now be resolved and the frontend will compile successfully with the modern styling applied.

I tried t create a diagram with a prompt &quot;Create a simple VPC Peering diagram for AWS Cloud with AWS Icons&quot; no action. fix it and even the frontend view is not professional

---

I'll fix the AI generation issue and improve the frontend to be more professional. Let me start by adding the missing environment variables and fixing the AI service.

---

Adding missing microservices URLs to environment variables

---

Adding VPC peering template to AI service and updating prompt detection

---

Fixing AI generation to use microservice URL and better error handling

---

Creating professional CSS with modern gradients, glass morphism, and smooth animations

---

Updating dashboard with professional styling, better spacing, and modern design elements

---

Updating create diagram cards with professional styling and consistent design

---


Now I've fixed both issues:

## ✅ **AI Generation Fixed:**

1. **Added VPC Peering Template** - The AI service now recognizes "VPC" and "peering" keywords
2. **Fixed Service URL** - Dashboard now correctly calls the microservice at `http://localhost:3001`
3. **Added Environment Variables** - Microservice URLs are now properly configured
4. **Better Error Handling** - More detailed error messages for debugging

## ✅ **Professional Frontend Design:**

1. **Modern Color Scheme** - Purple/blue gradient theme throughout
2. **Glass Morphism Effects** - Translucent cards with backdrop blur
3. **Professional Typography** - Better font weights and spacing
4. **Consistent Icons** - Gradient icon containers with hover effects
5. **Smooth Animations** - Fade-in, slide-up, and hover transitions
6. **Better Layout** - Improved spacing and visual hierarchy

### **Key Visual Improvements:**
- **Header**: Professional glass header with gradient logo
- **Stats Cards**: Clean stat cards with gradient icons
- **AI Prompt**: Special styling for AI generation section
- **Create Cards**: Hover effects and gradient borders
- **Buttons**: Gradient buttons with glow effects
- **Background**: Subtle gradient background

### **To Test VPC Peering:**
1. Start services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
2. Go to dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. Click "AI Generate"
4. Enter: "Create a simple VPC Peering diagram for AWS Cloud with AWS Icons"
5. Click "Generate Architecture"

The AI should now recognize the VPC peering request and generate the appropriate diagram with AWS-style icons and proper VPC peering topology.
